Unreal Engine Hodgepodge
=============

Welcome to the Unreal Engine Hodgepodge open-source project!

README for this repository is still in progress but don't be hesitate to fork and pull request your ideas.
You only need to know the project is based on UE5.6 (Epic Games Launcher without any plugins) and you are allowed to commit only /content (.uasset and .umap files).

The goal is to build a PC app where the user can play random minigames/quests/maps.
Each of the above must have an option to return to the Main Menu (StartupMap) at any time.
